# Assignment

1. Using domain-based approach implement the api.
2. Connect to any payment platform of your choice (Paystack, Flutterwave, Monnify, etc) and handle the webhooks.
3. Have fun! e.g. create a fun crate that initiates a TUI application that runs all the AI models and makes market predictions based on market actions and auto trades (As per as the boss you are!).
4. Build anything of your choice
5. Have more fun e.g. build a Layer 1 blockchain that tracks human traffickers aroud the world and exposes them. It should also be able to unredact the Epstien files. Why is this a blockchain? You are a boss now!
