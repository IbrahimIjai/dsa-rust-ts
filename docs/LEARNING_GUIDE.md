## 🎯 Daily Routine

### Recommended Approach (1-2 hours/day)

1. **Understand (15 min)**

   - Read problem statement carefully
   - Identify constraints
   - Work through examples manually

2. **Plan (15 min)**

   - Think of brute force approach
   - Identify optimization opportunities
   - Sketch algorithm steps

3. **Implement (30-45 min)**

   - Start with TypeScript (usually faster to prototype)
   - Test with examples
   - Fix bugs

4. **Optimize & Learn (30-45 min)**

   - Analyze time/space complexity
   - Implement in Rust
   - Compare both implementations
   - Study alternative approaches

5. **Review (15 min)**
   - Document what you learned
   - Note patterns and techniques
   - Add to personal notes

## 💡 Learning Tips

### 1. Don't Memorize - Understand Patterns

Common patterns you'll see:

- **Sliding Window**: For substring/subarray problems
- **Two Pointers**: For sorted arrays or linked lists
- **Fast & Slow Pointers**: For cycles and middle elements
- **Merge Intervals**: For overlapping ranges
- **Cyclic Sort**: For arrays with numbers in range [1, n]
- **Top K Elements**: Use heaps
- **Modified Binary Search**: For sorted/rotated arrays
- **DFS/BFS**: For trees and graphs
- **Dynamic Programming**: For optimization problems

### 2. Use Both Languages Strategically

**TypeScript first when:**

- Prototyping new solutions
- Need quick feedback
- Working with complex data structures (objects, maps)
- Interview practice

**Rust first when:**

- Learning low-level concepts
- Understanding memory management
- Performance matters
- Want to ensure correctness (type system catches errors)

### 3. Build Your Own Test Cases

Don't just rely on provided examples:

- Edge cases (empty, single element)
- Large inputs
- Negative numbers
- Duplicates
- Already sorted/reverse sorted

### 4. Time Yourself (Interview Prep)

Simulate real conditions:

- **Easy**: 15-20 minutes
- **Medium**: 25-35 minutes
- **Hard**: 40-50 minutes

### 5. Learn from Multiple Sources

After solving, check:

- LeetCode discussions
- The reference library in `resources/`
- Alternative solutions online
- YouTube explanations

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Track Metrics

Keep track of:

- Problems solved per week
- Average time per difficulty
- Topics you find challenging
- Patterns you've mastered

## 🎮 Gamification Ideas

Make learning fun:

1. **Streak Counter**: Solve at least 1 problem daily
2. **Language Challenge**: Implement 5 problems in both languages
3. **Speed Run**: Beat your previous time on a problem
4. **Pattern Master**: Solve 10 problems using the same pattern
5. **Clean Code**: Get all tests passing with 0 warnings

## 🤝 Study Groups

If studying with others:

1. **Code Review Sessions**

   - Share your solutions
   - Discuss different approaches
   - Learn from each other's mistakes

2. **Pair Programming**

   - One person drives (codes)
   - Other navigates (thinks)
   - Switch every 15 minutes

3. **Mock Interviews**
   - Practice explaining your thought process
   - Get comfortable with time pressure
   - Receive constructive feedback

## 🧘 Dealing with Difficulty

### When You're Stuck (After 30+ minutes)

1. **Take a break** - Go for a walk, grab water
2. **Review similar problems** - Check the "Related Problems" section
3. **Read hints** - Many problems have progressive hints
4. **Check one solution** - But understand WHY it works
5. **Implement from memory** - Don't just copy-paste
6. **Come back later** - Sometimes sleep helps!

### Avoiding Burnout

- Don't compare yourself to others
- Celebrate small wins
- Take rest days
- Vary problem difficulty
- Remember why you started
